# ResNet GoogLeNet VGG and Transfer Learning on CIFAR-10 Using PyTorch
I have implemented convolutional neural networks to perform image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 pixel color images categorized into 10 classes, with each class having 6,000 images. There are 50,000 images for training the model and 10,000 images for testing it.

I Implemented light versions of the VGG and ResNet and GoogLeNet architectures. I also selected ResNet18 to train extensively on the dataset with auxiliary methods and reported the results.
The confusion matrices are calculated and analyzed for the models. 

A pre-trained version of ResNet18 is chosen and is applied transfer learning techniques. The results are reported and compared with previous results.
